# Twitter Lorem

A lorem ipsum type text generator, using the twitter API search functionality to create sentences to be used as filler text.

## Getting Started
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies

When I was making this app, I knew that I wanted to just be grabbing the text from peoples tweets that I was getting returned from the API call. Once I got that working I went about setting up my databases and making all the RESTful routes communicate properly between database and the client side front-end.
